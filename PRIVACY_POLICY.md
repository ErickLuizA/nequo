## Nequo: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the **Nequo** app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by **Erick Luiz**. 
The source code is available on GitHub under the **MIT** license. 
The app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not developed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data  created by you (like favorite quotes) is stored on your device only.
Which can be erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Erick Luiz.
